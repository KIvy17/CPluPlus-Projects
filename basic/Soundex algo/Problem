The well-known Soundex algorithm (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex) determines whether two English words are similar in sound. 
At the entrance he takes the word and replaces it with some four-character code. If the codes of two words match, then the words, as a rule, sound similar.

You need to implement this algorithm. It works like this:

The first letter of the word is saved.
The rest of the word:
letters, denoting, as a rule, vowels: a, e, h, i, o, u, w и y — discarded;
the remaining letters (consonants) are replaced with numbers from 1 to 6, with the same numbers corresponding to the sound of the letters:
1: b, f, p, v
2: c, g, j, k, q, s, x, z
3: d, t
4: l
5: m, n
6: r
Any sequence of identical numbers is reduced to one such number.
The final line is truncated to the first four characters. If the length of the string is less than the required, the missing characters are replaced by a 0.
Examples:
аmmonium → ammnm → a5555 → a5 → a500
implementation → implmnttn → i51455335 → i514535 → i514

Input format
The input is one non-empty word, written in lowercase Latin letters. The word length does not exceed 20 characters.

Output format
Type a four-letter code for the word.
