Consider a sequence of integers of length n. The window with the length of k moves along it with step 1, that is, first in the window the first k numbers are visible,

the next step in the « window » will be k numbers, starting with the second, and so on until the end of the sequence. It is required for each position of the « window » to determine the minimum in it.

Input format
The first line of input contains two natural numbers n and k (n ≤ 150000, k ≤ 10000, k ≤ n) - the length of the sequence and « window », respectively. The next line contains n numbers - the sequence itself.

Output format
The output data must contain n - k + 1 lines - the minimum for each position of the « window ».

Notes
Please note that a solution with a direct calculation of the minimum for each window position will not pass in time. One way to solve the problem is to use the std::multiset container to store the contents of the window and quickly get the minimum.
