Have you ever played the computer game "Minesweeper"?
url https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapper_ (game)
In this game, mines are placed on a rectangular field. You must clear the field. On each cell not occupied by a mine, it is written how many mines are located in the cells around it.

One student decided to write a class for his implementation of this game. 
The class should be able to create a rectangular field of the given sizes, put a "mine" in the specified cell (cell indices start from zero), and also record in each free cell the number of mines around it. 
In addition, there should be an operator << that prints the field (and prints "stars" instead of mines).
Unfortunately, the student code contains errors and does not pass the tests. Help him to fix and pass the program. Student code is available at https://gist.github.com/alzobnin/862287ba2ec092d5e55272157ffb01af

Notes
Your solution should not contain main function. Your program will be built with this main function (approximately): https://gist.github.com/alzobnin/3a3565bfa57608c0967f9876028d6f9c.
